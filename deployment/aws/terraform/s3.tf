# Gap-backlog Patches 5/7/21 (Sep 2026 audit): complaint media storage,
# replacing the local-disk stub (StorageService's Javadoc has the full
# swap-in contract this fulfills). Bucket name includes the AWS account
# ID's region+project+environment (not just project+environment) because
# S3 bucket names are globally unique across ALL AWS accounts, not just
# within this one.
#
# NOT VERIFIED: no live AWS account reachable from this sandbox to apply
# this against - validated by manual review only, consistent with every
# other file in this directory (see ec2.tf/rds.tf's own NOT VERIFIED
# notes).
