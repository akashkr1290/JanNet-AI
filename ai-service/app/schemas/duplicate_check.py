Request/response schemas for POST /api/v1/ai/duplicate-check
(SRS 20.3, 15.6 Duplicate Detection Module, 21.5).

DECISION - candidates travel in the request body (ADDITION beyond the
literal SRS 20.3 contract, which only lists
`{complaint_id, image_embedding, latitude, longitude}`): SRS 21.5 Input is
"image embedding vector, GPS coordinates, timestamp" for the *new*
submission only, with no explicit carrier for the "existing open
complaints in the same ward" (15.6 Inputs) this service is supposed to
compare against. ARCHITECTURE.md Section 2.3 (locked Phase 1) is explicit
that this service is "stateless with respect to business data ... does not
itself own the complaint record, MySQL" - so it cannot look candidates up
itself the way a stateful service could. The caller (Spring Boot, which
does own the complaint record) must supply the candidate set. This mirrors
exactly how Phase 7/8 resolved the image_url/image_base64 gap for
/classify: a documented, backend-facing addition to the literal contract,
not a deviation from the architecture. Recorded in
PROJECT_INTEGRATION.md Section 6.

`image_embedding` (the SRS's literal field name) is realized here as
perceptual-hash-comparable image bytes (`image_url`/`image_base64`, same
pattern as ClassifyRequest), not a learned embedding vector - see
app/services/duplicate_service.py's module docstring for why: no trained
embedding/YOLO model ships with this repo (ARCHITECTURE.md Section 5,
unchanged since Phase 7), so this service computes a perceptual hash
(difference hash) instead. SRS 15.6 Features literally lists "image
similarity comparison (perceptual hashing / embedding similarity)" as
either being acceptable - perceptual hashing is the one that needs no
trained weights and is honestly implementable in this environment today.
