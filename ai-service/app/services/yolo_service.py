"""
YOLOv11 object/issue detection wrapper (SRS 15.4 Features, 21.1).

Per ARCHITECTURE.md Section 5: "No trained model exists yet. Phase 7 (AI
Service) will build the real model-loading architecture, dataset structure,
training/eval/inference configuration, and versioning/placement
conventions - but will not fabricate a trained model, an accuracy number,
or a live prediction. Anything model-dependent is explicitly marked
unavailable until a real model is trained and placed per that phase's
documented instructions."

This module is therefore real, functional model-loading code that will
correctly load and run inference against a real Ultralytics YOLO ``.pt``
weights file the moment one is placed at settings.yolo_model_path (see
models/README.md for the placement/versioning convention) - but since no
such file ships with this repo, `is_available()` is False in every
environment until someone adds one, and `classify()` always returns the
documented "no model available" result rather than inventing a prediction.
