Centralized settings for the AI Service (Phase 7).

All configuration is environment-variable driven (pydantic-settings), matching
this project's established convention from the Spring Boot backend
(application.yml env-var overrides) and Flutter (--dart-define). See
.env.example for the full documented list and SRS section references.
