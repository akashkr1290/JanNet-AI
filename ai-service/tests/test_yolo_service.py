"""
Phase 20 (extended by Gap-backlog Patch 1, Sep 2026 audit): unit tests for
app/services/yolo_service.py's model-loading contract (ARCHITECTURE.md
Section 5) - the single most important honesty guarantee in this
codebase's AI layer: this must never fabricate a detection or silently
report model_available: true.

A real trained weights file (models/yolov11-civic-v1.1.pt) now ships with
this repo and app/config.py's default yolo_model_path correctly points at
it (Gap-backlog Patch 1 fixed a filename mismatch that had silently
defeated this - see decisions-and-principles.md), so "no weights file
present" is no longer this environment's default state. The
TestYoloServiceNoWeightsFile class below now exercises that branch
explicitly via monkeypatched settings rather than relying on it being the
accidental default, and a new TestYoloServiceRealWeightsFile class
exercises the now-actually-reachable "weights file present, real
inference runs" branch - both actually executed this phase (ultralytics
is installed in this sandbox; see the module docstring this replaced for
why it previously wasn't).
