/// Phase 13 (Department Head Module) home shell for DEPARTMENT_HEAD
/// accounts - the Department Head equivalent of OfficerHomeScreen (Phase
/// 12, GOVERNMENT_OFFICER-only). Two tabs: "Queue" (reuses
/// OfficerQueueScreen as-is - ComplaintService.list already scopes a
/// DEPARTMENT_HEAD to their whole department's queue server-side, Phase
/// 12) and "Performance" (new this phase, SRS 16.2 "Department
/// Performance View"). Kept as a separate screen from OfficerHomeScreen
/// rather than one screen branching on role/tab-count - a plain
/// GOVERNMENT_OFFICER must never see the Performance tab (they have no
/// SRS-documented department-wide oversight permission), and the
/// Performance tab needs the signed-in user's own departmentId (fetched
/// once here via GET /users/me - see UserApi's Javadoc) that
/// OfficerHomeScreen has no reason to ever fetch.
///
/// Phase 16 addition: a third "Dashboard" tab (SRS 16.3 "Government
/// Dashboard (Overview)" screen - permission line: "Department Head,
/// Admin, Super Admin"), reusing the same fetched `departmentId` this
/// screen already loads for the Performance tab. Deliberately distinct
/// from "Performance": Performance (Phase 13) is officer-workload/SLA-
/// compliance-focused with a "Reassign Officer" action; Dashboard (Phase
/// 16) is the broader KPI/heatmap/category-trend view with no per-
/// officer breakdown and no reassignment action - see
/// GovernmentDashboardScreen's Javadoc for the full scope split.
