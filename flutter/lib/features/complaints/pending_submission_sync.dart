/// Gap-backlog Patch 45 (final recheck, Sep 2026): automatic upload of a
/// complaint that could not be sent because the network was unavailable.
///
/// When a submission fails without any server response (no connection,
/// timeout), the complete submission - photo path, description, the
/// confirmed incident-location fields, queued time - is stored here. [start] then retries
/// automatically whenever the app returns to the foreground and every 60
/// seconds while it is open. Uses only packages the app already depends on
/// (flutter_secure_storage, image_picker's XFile) - no connectivity plugin; a retry is
/// simply attempted and a network failure leaves the item queued.
///
/// If the SERVER rejects the complaint (an ApiException - e.g. validation),
/// automatic retry stops and the citizen is told, so a permanently invalid
/// item can never loop forever. Honest limits: retries only run while the
/// app process is alive (no OS background job), and if the OS has purged
/// the cached photo file the citizen is asked to re-submit.
